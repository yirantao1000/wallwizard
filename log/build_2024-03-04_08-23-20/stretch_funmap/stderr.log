/home/hello-robot/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/setuptools_scm/_integration/setuptools.py:30: RuntimeWarning: 
ERROR: setuptools==59.6.0 is used in combination with setuptools_scm>=8.x

Your build configuration is incomplete and previously worked by accident!
setuptools_scm requires setuptools>=61

Suggested workaround if applicable:
 - migrating from the deprecated setup_requires mechanism to pep517/518
   and using a pyproject.toml to declare build dependencies
   which are reliably pre-installed before running the build tools
